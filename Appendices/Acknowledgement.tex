First, I would like to thank Prof. Dr.-Ing. R\"{u}diger Dillmann for recommending me for the InterACT program and supporting me throughout my work.\\

In addition, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Marina Florina Balcan for supervising me during my stay at Carnegie Mellon University where she gave me the opportunity to work on very interesting research topics. Also, Nina supported me with insightful discussions, very helpful guidance and the opportunity to bring in my own ideas. After my stay at CMU, Nina helped me to complete the project to have everything necessary to write this thesis.\\

My thanks also go to the Automated Algorithm Reading Group and Nina's Learning Theory Group, where we had a lot of interesting discussions about state-of-the-art research that allowed me to learn a lot during my stay at CMU. Especially, I would like to thank Travis Dick, who supported me a lot during the implementation of the framework, the theoretical part of this work and also by finding interesting ideas to apply the introduced algorithms.\\

Last but not least, I would like to thank my parents, my brother and my friends who supported me not only during my studies.
