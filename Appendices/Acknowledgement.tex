First, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. RÃ¼diger Dillmann for recommending me for the InterACT program and supporting me throughout my work.\\

In addition, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Marina-Florina Balcan for supervising me during my stay at Carnegie Mellon University where she gave me the opportunity to work on very interesting research topics. Also, Nina supported me with insightful discussions, very helpful guidance and the option to bring in my own ideas and wishes. After my stay at CMU, Nina helped me to wrap up the project to have everything necessary to write this thesis and also submit this work as a contribution to NeurIPS 2019.\\

My thanks also go to the Automated Algorithm Reading Group and Nina's Learning Theory Group, where we had a lot of interesting discussions about state-of-the-art research that allowed me to learn a lot during my stay at CMU. Especially, I would like to thank Travis Dick, who supported me a lot during the implementation of the framework, the theoretical part of this work and also by finding interesting ideas to apply the introduced algorithms.\\

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family who supported me not only during my studies.
