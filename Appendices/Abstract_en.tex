Unsupervised learning is popular in several domains, such as grouping of images or websites, detecting outliers or providing recommendations. Often, there are many algorithms that work similarly but lead to different results. Depending on the data, one algorithm will work better than another, making it a non-trivial decision to choose the right algorithm. This is because worst-case guarantees for the algorithms have to be assumed, as there mostly is no prior information about the data, e.g.\ about its distribution. We solve the algorithm selection problem for agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms, where we propose a parameterized distance function between two clusters that weights the single, average and complete linkage distance individually and allows us to interpolate linearly between two of the different linkage strategies.\\

With our framework, we outperform all of the discussed linkage strategies for a variety of datasets. In addition, we apply the framework to learn the best metric for a dataset (i.e.\ the best feature representation of the data points), where we again achieve outstanding results for a variety of learning tasks. This thesis summarizes the algorithmic decisions we made to come up with the ``$\alpha$-linkage'' algorithm as well as the results we obtained when applying the proposed algorithm to real-world image and text data.
