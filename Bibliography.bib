	abstract = {Not only do children learn effortlessly, they do so quickly and with a remarkable ability to use what they have learned as the raw material for creating new stuff. Lake et al. describe a computational model that learns in a similar fashion and does so better than current deep learning algorithms. The model classifies, parses, and recreates handwritten characters, and can generate new letters of the alphabet that look {\textquotedblleft}right{\textquotedblright} as judged by Turing-like tests of the model{\textquoteright}s output in comparison to what real humans produce.Science, this issue p. 1332People learning new concepts can often generalize successfully from just a single example, yet machine learning algorithms typically require tens or hundreds of examples to perform with similar accuracy. People can also use learned concepts in richer ways than conventional algorithms{\textemdash}for action, imagination, and explanation. We present a computational model that captures these human learning abilities for a large class of simple visual concepts: handwritten characters from the world{\textquoteright}s alphabets. The model represents concepts as simple programs that best explain observed examples under a Bayesian criterion. On a challenging one-shot classification task, the model achieves human-level performance while outperforming recent deep learning approaches. We also present several {\textquotedblleft}visual Turing tests{\textquotedblright} probing the model{\textquoteright}s creative generalization abilities, which in many cases are indistinguishable from human behavior.},
